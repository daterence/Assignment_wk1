    <h1>Golden Retriever</h1>
    
    <p>
      The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the United
      States. The breed’s friendly, tolerant attitude makes them great family
      pets, and their intelligence makes them highly capable working dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Golden Retrievers excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, sniffing
      out contraband for law enforcement, and as therapy and service dogs.
      They’re also natural athletes and do well in dog sports such as agility
      and competitive obedience.
